## Scheduling Projects
This is a repository for projects related to scheduling.

Using Python as primary language.

Using Google Colab, Pycharm for code dev.


### Current (2021.08.09)

- Finished MIN+CCA code 
- Thinking of using a different base for MIN-CCA method such as HASA-CCA, ACTA-CCA, etc.
- Doing code review on using DNN for scheduling
- Thinking of acquiring optimal scheduling data for training data for ML methods
- Doing research on other feasible solutions for optimization of multiprocessor scheduling

### Past (2021.08.06)

- Completed scheduling code for major rule-based heuristics

    - FIFO, HASA, ACTA, MAX-MIN, MIN-MIN
- Completed scheduling code for meta-heuristic methods

    - 2 part genetic algorithm, SAM+HASA, CCA

- Working on code related to MIN+CCA
- Doing code review on using DNN for scheduling
- Thinking of acquiring optimal scheduling data for training data for ML methods
- Doing research on other feasible solutions for optimization of multiprocessor scheduling
